# NORG - NORG is a Note ORGanizer

norg is a simple commandline script written in python3 that is to put an end to the madness that is
how disorganized my notes are. It aims to help me create notes easier in more manageable and maintainable
way such that I can look back in years later to go make sense out of it.
